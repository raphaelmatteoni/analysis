## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/raphaelmatteoni/analysis.git
cd analysis
```

2. Check your Ruby version with `ruby -v`.

## Usage

### Weather Data Analysis

Run `ruby weather_analysis.rb` to find the day with the smallest temperature spread in the `w_data.dat` file.

### Premier League Analysis

Run `ruby soccer_analysis.rb` to find the team with the smallest goal difference in the `soccer.dat` file.

## Project Structure

- `weather_analysis.rb`: Weather analysis script.
- `soccer_analysis.rb`: Premier League analysis script.
